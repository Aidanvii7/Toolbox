# Toolbox
Toolbox is a collection of libraries for Android that aim to ease some areas of development. In particular, it provides useful abstractions for Android's databinding library that eases the implementation of an MVVM style architecture. It does this while also keeping your view models and their contracts to views expressive.

Currently it provides the following functionality:
- [Observable property delegates](delegates-observable/README.md)
- [Observable property delegates for Android Databinding](delegates-observable-databinding/README.md)
- [Observable Architecture Components ViewModel](databinding-arch-viewmodel/README.md)
- [RecyclerView bindings](adapterviews-databinding-recyclerview/README.md)
- [ViewPager bindings](adapterviews-databinding-recyclerpager/README.md)

# Alpha status
This library is currently in alpha, meaning that the API may change from version to version, and also that I am looking for feedback.
